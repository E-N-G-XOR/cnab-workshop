# [CNAB][cnab] / Duffle Workshop

> [Cloud Native Application Bundles (CNAB)][cnab] are a standard packaging format for multi-component distributed applications. It allows packages to target different runtimes and architectures. It empowers application distributors to package applications for deployment on a wide variety of cloud platforms, cloud providers, and cloud services. It also provides the capabilities necessary for delivering multi-container applications in disconnected environments.
